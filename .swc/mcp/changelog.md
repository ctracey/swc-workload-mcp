## Session — planning the MCP conversion `2026-05-21`

- Created branch `mcp` and registered it in `.swc/_meta.json`.
- Scaffolded the planning docs under `.swc/mcp/` and filled them in
  through the full six-stage planning workflow: context, intent, solution,
  delivery, breakdown, finalise.
- Decided to wrap the existing `swc_workload` CLI with a lightweight Python
  MCP server (subprocess + `--json`) rather than refactor the CLI.
- Recorded the agreed approach in `architecture.md` (tech stack, layout,
  constraints), `notes.md` (decisions, open questions, deferred items),
  `plan.md` (goal, features, delivery shape, out of scope), `workload.md`
  (5 phases broken into 17 sub-items), and `pipeline.md` (build, dev env,
  acceptance).
- Motivation: produce a planning artefact a future session can pick up
  and execute from cold without re-deriving the conversation.
